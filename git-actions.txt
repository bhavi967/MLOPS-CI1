Step-by-step explanation
Workflow name

name: CI Workflow
This is just the display name you’ll see in GitHub → Actions.

When it runs (triggers)

on.push.branches: [main] → runs every time you push to main.

on.pull_request.branches: [main] → runs for PRs targeting main.

Jobs & runner

jobs.test.runs-on: ubuntu-latest
Defines a single job called test, executed on a fresh Ubuntu VM.

Checkout repository

uses: actions/checkout@v2
Pulls your repo’s code into the runner so the next steps can access it.

Set up Python

uses: actions/setup-python@v2 with python-version: '3.9'
Installs Python 3.9 on the runner and makes it available in $PATH.

Install dependencies

Upgrades pip, then installs pytest and streamlit.
(You can switch to pip install -r requirements.txt if you keep deps there.)

Run tests

Currently you have:
pytest _test.py explain step by step
That will fail because explain and step will be treated as extra paths.
✅ Fix: Use just pytest _test.py (or pytest -q _test.py for quieter output)
